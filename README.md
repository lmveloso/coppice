# Coppice

A desktop app for managing Git worktrees, Claude AI sessions, and development workflows in a unified interface. Built with Tauri v2, React, and Rust.

Coppice lets you work across multiple Git worktrees simultaneously, each with its own terminal sessions, Claude AI tabs, diff viewers, and configurable runners — all in one window.

## Features

### Worktree Management
- Create worktrees from existing or new branches
- Rename, pin, archive, and delete worktrees
- Live branch status polling (3-second intervals)
- Automatic `git worktree prune` before operations

### Integrated Terminal
- Full PTY-backed terminal sessions via xterm.js
- Per-worktree terminal tabs (unlimited)
- Cross-platform shell support (respects `$SHELL` on macOS/Linux, PowerShell on Windows)
- Unicode rendering for Claude Code UI elements
- Buffered output streaming (50ms flush interval) for smooth rendering

### Configurable Runners
- Define setup, build, and run commands per project
- Runners persist across worktree switches via an off-screen terminal pool
- Live status indicators (running/stopped/idle)
- Auto-run setup scripts on new worktree creation

### GitHub Integration
- Fetch PR status and check runs for any branch (requires `gh` CLI)
- Create PRs directly from the app
- View failed CI logs inline
- CI status badges on worktree entries

### File Diff Viewer
- Side-by-side diffs powered by Monaco Editor
- Two modes: uncommitted changes (HEAD vs working tree) and PR diffs (merge-base vs HEAD)
- Syntax highlighting for 20+ languages

### External Tool Launchers
- Open worktree in VS Code, native terminal, or file manager
- Cross-platform support (Finder/Explorer/xdg-open)

## Installation

Download the latest build from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/iamfozzy/coppice/actions) artifacts or [Releases](https://github.com/iamfozzy/coppice/releases).

### macOS — "App is damaged" fix

Since the app is not code-signed, macOS quarantines downloaded apps. After extracting, run:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/Coppice.app
```

Then open Coppice normally. You only need to do this once.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **Rust** (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- **`gh` CLI** (for GitHub features) — [install](https://cli.github.com)

### Platform-specific

**macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools
```sh
xcode-select --install
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev \
  patchelf
```

**Windows:** C++ Build Tools (via Visual Studio Installer)

## Development

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server with hot reload
npx tauri dev
```

This launches Vite on `http://localhost:1420` and opens the Tauri window with live frontend reloading.

### Build

```sh
# Production build
npx tauri build

# Build for specific target
npx tauri build --target aarch64-apple-darwin
```

Bundles are output to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions builds on every push to `main` and on tags:

| Platform | Target |
|----------|--------|
| macOS | `aarch64-apple-darwin` (Apple Silicon) |
| macOS | `x86_64-apple-darwin` (Intel) |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | native |
| Windows | native |

Build artifacts (`.dmg`, `.app`, `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.msi`, `.exe`) are uploaded as workflow artifacts. Tagged pushes (`v*`) create draft GitHub releases.

## Architecture Notes

- **Per-worktree isolation** — Each worktree gets its own set of tabs (terminal, Claude, diff) and runners, stored in `tabsByWorktree` and `runnersByWorktree` maps.
- **Terminal pool** — Runner terminals are rendered off-screen and reparented into the visible UI on demand, preserving terminal state across tab switches.
- **Event-driven PTY** — Output streams via Tauri events (`pty-output-{sessionId}`) rather than polling. A dedicated flush thread batches output every 50ms.
- **SQLite with WAL** — Database uses Write-Ahead Logging for concurrent read/write. Foreign keys enabled with cascading deletes on worktrees.
- **Git CLI** — All git operations shell out to `git` / `gh` directly (no libgit2), keeping the dependency surface small and behavior consistent with the user's git config.
